## The Cub3d Project

The Cub3d project is a 3D game engine written in C that uses raycasting to simulate a 3D environment. The goal of the project is to use the skills you've learned in the C Programming module to create a playable game that lets the user navigate a maze-like environment.

The player's view is rendered using raycasting, where the game engine sends out a series of rays from the player's position to determine what objects are visible and where they should appear on the screen. The project also involves loading textures and other game assets, handling user input, and implementing basic game mechanics such as collision detection and player movement.

## Player Movement

To move the player around the environment, you'll need to implement a simple algorithm that updates their position based on user input. The most common way to do this is to use keyboard input to move the player forward, backward, left, and right.

To update the player's position, you'll need to keep track of their current position and orientation, and then modify these values based on user input. You'll also need to implement collision detection so that the player doesn't move through walls or other objects in the scene.

## Raycasting

Raycasting is a rendering technique that simulates a 3D environment by projecting 2D slices of the scene onto a 2D screen. The basic idea is to cast a number of rays from the player's position through the 2D screen and into the 3D environment. By tracing the path of these rays through the scene, the game engine can determine what objects are visible and where they should appear on the screen.

The best algorithm to use for raycasting is the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm, which works by incrementally stepping along the ray until it hits an object in the scene. The DDA algorithm is simple and efficient, making it well-suited for real-time applications like games.

To draw lines using raycasting, you'll need to use the Bresenham's line drawing algorithm. Bresenham's algorithm works by calculating the error between the actual position of a pixel on the line and the desired position, and using that error to determine which direction to take the line. This algorithm is also efficient and easy to implement, making it a popular choice for line drawing in games.

## Wall Rendering

To render walls using raycasting, you'll need to iterate over each vertical "slice" of the screen and cast a ray for each one. For each ray, you'll need to determine the distance to the closest object in the scene, and use that distance to calculate the height of the corresponding wall slice.

To calculate the height of the wall slice, you'll need to use the "field of view" (FOV) of the player to determine the angle of the ray and the distance to the wall. Then, using some trigonometry, you can calculate the height of the wall slice based on the distance and the FOV.

Once you've calculated the height of each wall slice, you can use the texture mapping algorithm to apply the appropriate texture to each one. Finally, you'll need to use the Bresenham's algorithm to draw the wall slice on the screen.

## Texture Mapping

Texture mapping is a technique used to apply textures to 3D objects in the scene. In the Cub3d project, you'll need to load textures from image files and apply them to the walls in the environment.

To do this, you'll need to create a "texture buffer" that stores the color values of each pixel in the texture. Then, when rendering the scene, you can use the raycasting algorithm to determine which part of the wall is visible, and map the appropriate portion of the texture onto that part of the wall.

## Conclusion

The Cub3d project is a complex undertaking that requires a solid understanding of raycasting, texture mapping, player movement, and other key concepts in game development. By carefully implementing these algorithms and techniques, you can create a playable 3D game that impresses your peers and fellow developers.
